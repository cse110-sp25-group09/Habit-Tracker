# Phase 1 CI/CD Pipeline Status Report: Habit-Tracker Project

## Introduction
The goal of Phase 1 is to establish a basic CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, automated testing, and ensures collaborative development. This aligns with the team’s mission to deliver a reliable and maintainable application through rigorous automation and adherence to agile practices. By integrating tools for linting, testing, and code analysis, the pipeline reflects the team’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and technical excellence.

## Current Functional Components
### 1. **SonarQube Code Quality Analysis**
   - **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml`
   - **Status**: Active on `push` and `pull_request` events to `main`.
   - **Details**:  
     SonarQube (via SonarCloud) performs static code analysis to detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. The workflow installs dependencies, builds the project, and executes the SonarCloud scanner. Current results are visible in the SonarCloud dashboard, with metrics for maintainability and reliability.

### 2. **CodeQL Security Scanning**
   - **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`
   - **Status**: Active on `push`, `pull_request`, and a weekly schedule.
   - **Details**:  
     GitHub’s CodeQL performs automated security scans to identify vulnerabilities in JavaScript and TypeScript. The analysis runs in parallel with other jobs, providing actionable feedback directly in pull requests.

### 3. **Pull Request Review Enforcement**
   - **Configuration**: GitHub branch protection rules.
   - **Status**: Active.
   - **Details**:  
     Every pull request requires approval from **two reviewers** before merging into `main`. This ensures collaborative oversight and reduces the risk of introducing errors.

### 4. **Linter (ESLint) and Formatter (Prettier)**
   - **Project Integration**: Configured via `package.json` scripts (`lint` and `format`).
   - **Status**: Partially implemented (local use only).  
   - **Details**:  
     ESLint enforces code style and syntax rules, while Prettier standardizes formatting. These tools are not yet integrated into the CI pipeline but are available for manual execution.

### 5. **Unit Testing with Jest**
   - **Project Integration**: Tests are written and executable locally via `npm test`.
   - **Status**: Not yet automated in CI.  
   - **Details**:  
     Jest is used for unit testing, but test execution and results reporting are not part of the current GitHub Actions workflows.

### 6. **Documentation Generation with JSDoc**
   - **Project Integration**: Configured via `package.json` scripts.
   - **Status**: Manual execution only.  
   - **Details**:  
     JSDoc generates API documentation from inline comments. This process is not automated in the pipeline.


## Planned or In-Progress Items
Status(Planned):
- Other testing including e2e (end to end) and pixel testing is also possible so you may decide to use an environment that does numerous things.
- Code Coverage Enforcement -> Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
- Dependency Vulnerability Scan

Status(In-Progress Items)
- Updating function testing 
- creating proper tags for the Pull Request Review Enforcement
- Improving Documentation Generation with JSDoc
  

## Conclusion

Phase 1 CI/CD for Habit-Tracker provies basic automated linting, formatting, static analysis, documentation generation, and unit tests—anchored by mandatory peer review—to uphold our code quality and collaboration standards. The next steps focus on extending test coverage into E2E and visual regression, tightening coverage gates, and introducing vulnerability scanning. Key dependencies include selecting an E2E framework, finalizing our coverage thresholds, and configuring security scanners. Once these blockers are cleared, we will be well-positioned to progress into Phase 2 enhancements and deployment automation.
